Before installing client make sure you clone the server repo from :
https://t2013anurag@bitbucket.org/t2013anurag/softard.git

```sh
$ sudo npm install
After installing all dependencies : 
# Get the latest stable release of Sails
$ cd softard/
$ sails lift
```
This runs the project server on port 1337 by default.
Now we have the server up and running, we need to install client.
