Download the zip file for both client and server from onedrive :
Link :


```sh
$ sudo npm install
After installing all dependencies :
# Get the latest stable release of Sails
$ cd softard/
$ sails lift
```
This runs the project server on port 1337 by default.
Now we have the server up and running, we need to install client.



# softardclient

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

## Installation &nbsp;
**With [node](http://nodejs.org) [installed](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation/new-to-nodejs):**
```sh
# Get the latest stable release of Sails
$ sudo npm install
```
After installing all dependencies:
```sh
# Get the latest stable release of Sails
$ cd softardclient/
$ sails lift
```
The server by default runs on post 5000.

Go to http://localhost:5000
You will see the homepage. Note : you need to create your posts and perform all operations.
You have successfully installed the server and client.
